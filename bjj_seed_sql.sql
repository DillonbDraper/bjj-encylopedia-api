    (8,'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBf7uF5x8GQ','https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UBf7uF5x8GQ/hqdefault.jpg','Scissor Sweep for BJJ White Belts (Try These Adjustments)','The Scissor Sweep is one of the first Sweeps from Guard that most BJJ White Belts learn. And in a recent video where I covered some simple adjustments to the Keylock. Several of the White Belts that watch the channel asked for some tips on some of the really basic Brazilian Jiu-jitsu techniques that White Belts use. 

So I decided to cover the Scissor Sweep since this is one of the 1st sweeps most White Belts learn. In addition, the movement used for the Scissor Sweep will be used over and over again in Brazilian Jiujitsu. Whether you’re trying to sweep of if you’re trying to open guard and transition to other positions beside the full guard. 

In this video I show some simple adjustments and tweaks to the Scissor Sweep that have made this BJJ technique useable for me as a higher level belt and in addition been very helpful to many of my students. 

Simple things like turning the wrist over, grinding the hips up rather than simply coming up to the knees in mount have really helped.

Try combining these adjustments with some of the instruction your BJJ coach teaches you at your gym. 

I hope this video helps your BJJ Scissor Sweep regardless of whether you''re a White Belt or not. 

Thanks for watching!
